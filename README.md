**Color Changing Box**

This project demonstrates a simple yet visually appealing web page featuring a box that smoothly transitions through different colors.

**Concept**

HTML Structure: Basic HTML setup with a div to represent the color-changing box.

CSS Styling: Styling the div (size, initial color, transition effect).

JavaScript DOM Manipulation: Selecting the div element using document.querySelector().

JavaScript Array: Storing a list of color values for cycling.

JavaScript Functions: A changeColor() function to update the box's background color and cycle through the array of colors.

JavaScript Timing: Using setInterval() to trigger the color change function repeatedly.

**How to Run**

Save the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code into a single HTML file (e.g., index.html).
Open the index.html file in any modern web browser.

**Customization**

Experiment with different colors in the colors array.
Adjust the transition duration in the CSS to change the speed of color changes.
Modify the timing interval within setInterval() to change the frequency of the color changes.
